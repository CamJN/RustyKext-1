RustyKext
=========
Rust in OSX kernel usage example. The example is based on [rust-core](https://github.com/thestinger/rust-core), [rust.ko](https://github.com/tsgates/rust.ko) and [runtime-less discussion](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/3608).
The example is compilable with Nightly builds only because of dependence on unstable features.

Compiler version: Nightly Rust 1.4.0
